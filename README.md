## Machine Learning Project
# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** that predicts the price of diamonds based on their features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. The solution includes data processing, model training, and a simple web interface for user interaction.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
- **Objective**: Build a regression model to predict diamond prices accurately.  
- **Approach**:  
  1. **Data ingestion** â€“ Load raw data and split into training and testing sets.  
  2. **Data transformation** â€“ Clean, preprocess, and prepare features for modeling.  
  3. **Model training** â€“ Train ML models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, etc.) and evaluate performance.  
  4. **Pipeline** â€“ Create modular pipelines for training and prediction.  
  5. **Web application** â€“ A Flask app connects the trained model with a user-friendly interface.
